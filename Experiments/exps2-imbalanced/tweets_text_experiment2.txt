being voted most unique in high school and praised for my weirdness humor while back at home i was self harming
helplessness manifested as not getting out of bed for hours not eating for hours and dropping the ball all around
but as someone mentioned these symptoms have popped up in short lived episodes for some time in the past
but this last year has been about learning to celebrate my accomplishments within my newly limited capacity
there are some days that i pat myself on the back for meeting all of the obligations that used to be so natural
cw su cide me as a 7 year old writing a suicide note to my mom i wrote her a few during my childhood
dealing with white hetero therapist nonsense because my area lacks qpoc therapists
the countless vines tweets snapchats have made to make others laugh when i was crying when i was off media
learning to not feel like a burden for threads w 20 tweets about depression or for texting my friend for assurance
learning how to speak my needs but also tell folks that sometimes nothing can really help in some moments
like me crying myself to sleep most nights as a kid and praying to god to make me perfect and happy
being the friend that is always there emotionally and physically for my friends because that is what i always wanted
and ultimately have learned that sometimes depression is unstoppable and i need to learn to live with it
sometimes i have to fill my schedule all day so that am nowhere near my bed
my depression is a daily sometimes hourly negotiation with myself and my lack of will power
telling your friends you are just having an off day when your depression starts creeping in again
avoiding going to a counselor cus will have to accept that it is real not just something i think i have
nowadays a black hole that i try to hide from everyone most of all my doctors and pharmacists
the most difficult thing about my depression though being gentle with myself not judging myself forgiving myself
being a high functioning depressed person it led my psychiatrist to say my depression is not severe enough
it can be hard to pat myself on the back for getting out of bed when a year ago i would have done 30 things that day
ama sound corny but productivity is a capitalist enterprise and it cannot define our worth
looking for validation from others that am contributing to the world even when i know that is not where my worth is
finding victory in the little things remembering to eat shower clean up go outside those are tiny feats
been depressed since 16 got ptsd from imm detention anxiety yet i got diagnosed as adjustment disorder
worrying about saying too much because i do not want those i love to worry about me too much worrying lol
insomnia coupled with negative thoughts around my lack of my self worth
cutting off close friends for a few days bc i do not have it in me to pretend am ok or to tell them the truth
wondering if will ever experience happiness and getting too comfortable with feeling depressed
me hesitating in conversations and not wanting to say too much
it is getting better high school was a tough time for me but friends i have now are very supportive understanding
being uncomfortable when am not depressed and sliding into sad state of mind bc of comfortability
locked doors bc the more we do not talk about it the less we connect with our friends and family who suffer as well
sapping all joy away so i find vines that make me laugh like the one i just retweeted
this is me on a daily basis esp being in a nonprofit community oriented type of work
depressed since 12 unable to continue in critical course due to major depression surviving and fighting
waves of deep sadness and lethargy desire to be alone sometimes a moment sometimes a week
suffocation
to everyone sharing their story on thank you i started crying reading ur tweets a lot of them hit close to home
feeling like a bad christian because they say if i pray i will not feel like this anymore but i still do
keeping internal demons internal bc of the fear if anyone really knew what was going on they would only say pray
am functioning the wave is coming am functioning i feel the water am functioning here it comes am out of order
the inside of my eyelids
terrible decisions oversleeping under sleeping over eating binge watching
idk if it was useful to share what on the tl or if i brought up feelings ppl wanted to duck
the loss of all my former passion and hope
scratching a wound instead of applying ointment
is actually my first real tweet
loss of interest in everything that makes me happy
if you need to talk to after reading the crisis text line is 24 7
longing to art with gusto like i used to be able to
wishing i was not a poc bc my parents would be more open to talking about mental health instead of stop being sad
complete nothingness that consumes you whole leaves you all worn out dry and alone in the dark
countless jokes about my depression that people do not understand or agree with even though that is how i cope with it
losing the memory of entire conversations i had the same day not recalling ever having it
being overly exhausted yet unable to rest
happiness because we are masters at hiding our problems so we can tend to the problems of those we love
decades of noticing beauty practicing gratitude cultivating positive thoughts fighting to live despite the pain
overdue assignments insomnia and random emotional breakdowns
nothing extraordinary to outside observers but it feels like trying to run a marathon in shackles
when it is bad it means constantly being tired and looking for outward validation
unexplainable chronic feelings of emptiness and feelings of boredom
on good days a tremendous example of the human spirit capacity to persevere and overcome adversity
then they began to rt other tweets i realized that they struggle within the same fight they do not feel bad for me
suffocating weight dragging everything out of me bleakness pointlessness guilt and shame for existing
whatever or anyone else s whether barely enduring or overcoming it is nothing to be ashamed of
acting like normal with an extra smile while everything inside me is screaming
slow and hard won progress to become functional raise my happiness set point a little over years
it may be healing at a faster pace over these last 5 years or so
forgetfulness stress and struggling to cope with my daily activities
it is mild dysphoria these days in the past it was completely immobilizing life threatening
a lot of these are hitting home
the funny sunny girl full of jokes and in the inside there is emptiness sadness or pain but nor sun or fun
so many of your tweets often depression feels like wearing a heavy mask
am lazy which is the hardest part because people can not see how hard my mind is working trying to do the right thing
forgetting to eat
i do not know what nobody recognized it i only had the repeating thought i can not take this and i need help
not being able to enjoy my graduation from college
something so unusual apparently that several therapists doctors and psychiatrists only treated it after i pushed
looking forward to plans with friends but exhaustion forces me to cancel again and again isolation hurts
rt an inability to take care of myself and prioritize my health
the system gets me down that is how i react to all the shit disadvantages loss hate that is happening to me in it
a hashtag
dieser monolog wurde inspiriert durch den mydepressionlookslike den ich daf r aber nich entern wollte sigh
twitteratis bring to light with hashtag
hauling myself out of bed gritting my teeth taking care of everyone standing against a tide because what else
because what else is there because no one should have to face it alone because there is no other option
because i am a sword to beat the shadows back because i am a shield behind which you may shelter
me wondering if am even capable of being happy
depression is like dementors to me they suck out my happiness and fill with horror and worse i can not see it
physically not being able to keep even the smallest place tidy clean
days or weeks of lethargy and then sudden energy bursts that is what
am too exhausted to come up with something
not even having the energy to tweet
happiness because i do not burden anyone with it
ingratitude although i am beyond grateful this turns into guilt which turns into self loathing it does not end
laziness to others it is not
wishing i was in heaven now not wanting to live anymore hiding in my bed all day to escape the anxiety
a fear the world will find out how terrible i am and i will never succeed in anything
a highly successful person with a big smile on my face to hide the deep hate i feel toward myself every day
puttin babypowder on my hair because taking a shower seems unbearably hard and am a lunatic on the verge of meltdown
